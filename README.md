TechEdu is an Online E-Learning platform that provides courses in IT Field.  

The API for CRUD (Create Read Update Delete) operations on Database are written in PHP.  

PHP 5.6 is used in the TechEdu Backend API.  

The Database used is MySQL.

The API is made up of 12 PHP files. Each file has its

All files take data in POST. So, its mandatory to call
the API using HTTP POST method.

The API return response in JSON (Javascript Object

In each response, there will be a key called
‘Success’, whose value be Boolean depending
upon success of the operation on the server.

We have developed it using JAVA to work in CLI (Command
